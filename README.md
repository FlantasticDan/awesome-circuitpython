[CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython) is Adafruit's branch of MicroPython designed to simplify experimentation and education on low-cost microcontrollers. It makes it easier than ever to start prototyping by requiring no upfront desktop software downloads. With CircuitPython you can write clean and simple Python code to control hardware instead of having to use complex low-level languages like C or C++ (what Arduino uses for programming). It's great for beginners!

## Events

- [PyCon 2019 conference](https://us.pycon.org/2019/about/) - May 1 - 9, 2019, Cleveland, Ohio.  Digi-Key and Adafruit have teamed up for PyCon 2019 so every attendee (about 4,000!) will receive a SPECIAL EDITION Circuit Playground Express, running … CircuitPython.

This effort is to get Python on hardware to the most folks out there, at the events that bring people together.

This is just one of many efforts we’re teaming up with Digi-Key to continue to fuel all the developers from beginners to pro, using Python on microcontrollers - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/02/23/digi-key-and-adafruit-at-pycon-all-attendees-will-receive-a-circuit-playground-express-digikey-adafruit-pycon-pycon2019/) & [planning doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E36RHKZ57mnb8Ks3hEB1TmPv88w9sXep2_BD0im-Qvk/edit).

What else is happening? The CircuitPython team will be running several Open Spaces sessions (as they did last year), showing how to use CircuitPython on the Digi-Key / Adafruit PyCon special edition Circuit Playground Express. We’ll have extra addons to play with also: potentiometers, NeoPixel strips, and servos. The team will be running a CircuitPython Sprint for several days to work on CircuitPython libraries and CircuitPython core code. BYOMUSB “Bring your own Micro USB” cables, we’ll have some to borrow during the sprints/sessions, as well as some USB C adapters, good idea to bring one too!
